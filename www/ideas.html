				<h3> Performance analysis</h3>

				 <p> As we begin to use MarkUs is classes larger than 500
                 students, we would like to know what the performance
                 limitations are, and what we can do to mitigate them. If a
                 large number of students try to submit their assignments using
                 MarkUs in a short time window, where are the performance
                 bottlenecks? Rails? Database? Subversion? </p>

				<p>This project would involve setting up a test environment,
                profiling, and stress testing MarkUs. An applicant should have
                enough Linux knowledge to be able to set up concurrent tests and
                measure performance, and enough database knowledge to be able to
                do some profiling. Basic Ruby and Rails knowledge, web
                application knowledge would be a strong asset. (We realize this
                is a lot to ask, but for the right student, this could be a
                really rewarding project.) </p>

				<h3>Build a Git backend for MarkUs</h3> 

				<p>Student submissions are currently stored in Subversion
                repositories. The repositories are hidden from students who
                submit through the web interface, but MarkUs can be configured
                so that students use the Subversion repositories directly. Since
                Git and other DCSVS's have become more popular, we would like to
                provide the ability to plug Git repositories into MarkUs. </p>
				
				 <p>This project requires Git and Git Ruby bindings knowledge.
                (Probably won't work with Gitolite[1])</p>
				
				 <h3>Web-based PDF annotations</h3>
				
				 <p>MarkUs supports annotating student submitted PDF files. This
                is accomplished by converting the PDFs into JPEGs using
                imagemagick and then tracking absolute coordinates on the image.
                Is there a better way? This is a more exploratory project, since
                we don't know what technologies might come into play.</p>

			<h3>Integrated documentation system</h3>

			<p>As the user base for MarkUs grows, the need for better
            documentation becomes clear. It will be an interesting software
            design problem to create an integrated documentation system that
            tracks versions and configurations.</p>

			<p>This project requires some Ruby/Rails knowledge and a desire to
            create simple, elegant software.</p>

			<h3>A VM harness for the automated test framework</h3>

			<p>We have been working towards an automated test framework that
            allows students to submit their work and receive immediate feedback.
            To run student submitted code on a server, we need to think
            carefully about how to do this securely. Running the tests inside a
            locked down VM seems to be the most promising solution. </p>

			<p>This project requires Linux and VM knowledge, preferably with
            some system administration skills.</p>
